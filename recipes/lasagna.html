    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering wide, flat sheets of pasta with various fillings and sauces. Typically, it features a rich meat or vegetable-based ragù, creamy béchamel or ricotta cheese, and grated Parmesan or mozzarella cheese. These layers are assembled in a baking dish and baked to perfection, resulting in a hearty and flavorful casserole. The dish is known for its golden, bubbly top and the satisfying combination of textures, from the tender pasta to the savory fillings. Variations of lasagna include vegetarian options, seafood versions, and even unique regional twists. It is a beloved comfort food enjoyed worldwide, often served as a main course at family gatherings or special occasions.</p>
