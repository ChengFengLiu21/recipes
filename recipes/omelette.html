    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Omelette with Spring Onion Filling is a simple yet flavorful dish that combines the fluffiness of eggs with the fresh, aromatic crunch of spring onions. The eggs are beaten and seasoned lightly, then cooked until set but tender. A generous filling of finely chopped spring onions, sometimes saut√©ed for added sweetness, is added in the middle or folded into the omelette. This dish is versatile and quick, perfect for breakfast, brunch, or even a light meal. The balance of creamy eggs and the mildly sharp taste of spring onions makes it both comforting and refreshing.</p>
